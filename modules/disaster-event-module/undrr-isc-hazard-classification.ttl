The virus is thought to infect humans through the mucus membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth. Living virus has been isolated from faeces and urine but neither is thought to represent a major means of transmission. Fomites are thought to represent a low risk of transmission, but the risk has not yet been quantified. The risk of transmission is greatest in closed, poorly ventilated spaces where humans are in close proximity for ten to fifteen minutes and do not physically distance or wear a protective face covering (WHO, 2020)." .

The last confirmed outbreak of rinderpest was in 2001 and the disease was declared to have been eradicated globally in 2011 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Rinderpest was a highly contagious viral disease of animals that, throughout history, has resulted in the mortality of hundreds of millions of livestock and has caused significant disruption and damage to agricultural supply chains throughout the world. Rinderpest is the first animal disease eradicated worldwide. The last confirmed outbreak of rinderpest was in 2001. Rinderpest was declared as eradicated by 2011. The Rinderpest Secretariat (FAO and OIE joint activity) is engaged in safeguarding the global freedom, similar to what has been done for smallpox by the World Health Organization (OIE, 2019; FAO, 2020)." .

                   skos:definition """Hazardous pesticide contamination in soils often results from improperstorage of (obsolete) agrochemicals, as a result of which pesticides are spilled in the surroundings of the storage site, where they seep into the soil or are dispersed by wind. In some cases, pesticide spillage has been ongoing for many years. Such spillage may cause serious soil or groundwater contamination. In addition, highly toxic and persistent compounds have been used in agriculture for decades to control pests and diseases, which are proven to cause harm to non-target species.
Although international agreements are put in place to regulate the production and use of those highly toxic and persistent compounds they will still remain in soils for several more decades. Moreover, in some countries, the international agreements are not yet being implemented or fully implemented, and therefore toxic pesticides are still being used. When soil and groundwater are contaminated, crops, livestock and drinking water may become affected and, when they are consumed by people, health risks may occur (FAO, 2000).""" .

Alternative Definition: Land degradation is the reduction in the capability of the land to produce benefits from a particular land use under a specified form of land management (FAO, 1999).
Alternative Definition: Land degradation is a negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes including anthropogenic climate change, expressed as long-term reduction or loss of at least one of the following: biological productivity, ecological integrity or value to humans. [Note: This definition applies to forest and non-forest land. Changes in land condition resulting solely from natural processes (such as volcanic eruptions) are not considered to be land degradation. Reduction of biological productivity or ecological integrity or value to humans can constitute degradation, but any one of these changes need not necessarily be considered degradation.] (Olsson et al., 2019).""" .

Note: dS/m = decisiemens per metre this is equivalent to the measurement of electrical conductivity of the salinity which can also be described as millimho per centimetre, hence 1 dS/m = 1 mmho/cm. Once the dS/m is known this can be converted to either mg/L or parts per million (ppm) (University of California, 2020).""" .

Permafrost loss, also known as permafrost thaw is the progressive loss of ground ice in permafrost, usually due to input of heat. Thaw can occur over decades to centuries over the entire depth of permafrost ground, with impacts occurring while thaw progresses. During thaw, temperature fluctuations are subdued because energy is transferred by phase change between ice and water. After the transition from permafrost to non-permafrost, ground can be described as thawed (IPCC, 2019)." .

It has a low pressure centre and clouds spiralling towards the eyewall surrounding the ‘eye’. Its diameter is typically around 200 to 500 km, but can reach 1000 km. The related hazards are very violent winds, torrential rain, high waves, storm surges and in some cases tornadoes, causing direct effects such as flash floods, flooding, coastal inundation, and indirect effects such as landslides and mudslides. The winds blow anti-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere (WMO, 2020).
The intensity of tropical storms is based on the wind speed. A tropical storm is a tropical cyclone with the maximum sustained winds of 34 knots (17.5 m/s, 63 km/h) to 47 knots (24.2 m/s, 87 km/h) near the centre. When reaching this intensity, they are named in the interests of public safety (WMO, 2021).""" .

Violence can either be targeted or indiscriminate, motivated by certain aims, including political, religious, social, economic, ethnic, racial, or gender-based, or unintentional and can be initiated with the aim to directly or indirectly inflict harm, injury or death (Krug et al., 2002). Armed as well as non-armed forms of violence can occur both in conflict and non-conflict settings. Violence has been explicitly identified as a significant public health problem (Rutherford et al., 2007)." .
