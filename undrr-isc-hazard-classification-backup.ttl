The virus is thought to infect humans through the mucus membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth. Living virus has been isolated from faeces and urine but neither is thought to represent a major means of transmission. Fomites are thought to represent a low risk of transmission, but the risk has not yet been quantified. The risk of transmission is greatest in closed, poorly ventilated spaces where humans are in close proximity for ten to fifteen minutes and do not physically distance or wear a protective face covering (WHO, 2020)." .

In addition, highly toxic and persistent compounds have been used in agriculture for decades to control pests and diseases, which are proven to cause harm to non-target species.
Although international agreements are put in place to regulate the production and use of those highly toxic and persistent compounds they will still remain in soils for several more decades. Moreover, in some countries, the international agreements are not yet being implemented or fully implemented, and therefore toxic pesticides are still being used. When soil and groundwater are contaminated, crops, livestock and drinking water may become affected and, when they are consumed by people, health risks may occur (FAO, 2000).""" .

[Note: This definition applies to forest and non-forest land. Changes in land condition resulting solely from natural processes (such as volcanic eruptions) are not considered to be land degradation.

Note: dS/m = decisiemens per metre this is equivalent to the measurement of electrical conductivity of the salinity which can also be described as millimho per centimetre, hence 1 dS/m = 1 mmho/cm. Once the dS/m is known this can be converted to either mg/L or parts per million (ppm) (University of California, 2020).""" .

Movement is caused by shear stress, sufficient to produce permanent deformation, but too small to produce shear failure (adapted from Hutchinson, 1968; and Varnes, 1978)." .

They are rapid with long runouts and large volumes and often involve the entrainment of slope material, commonly therefore, giving rise to debris slides or flows. The motion of rock avalanches is massive such that the bulk of the rock fragments move together as a largely coherent mass (adapted from Collins, 2014 and USGS, no date)." .
